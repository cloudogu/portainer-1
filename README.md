**_Portainer_** is a lightweight management UI which allows you to **easily** manage your different Docker environments (Docker hosts or Swarm clusters).
**_Portainer_** is meant to be as **simple** to deploy as it is to use. It consists of a single container that can run on any Docker engine (can be deployed as Linux container or a Windows native container, supports other platforms too).
**_Portainer_** allows you to manage all your Docker resources (containers, images, volumes, networks and more!) It is compatible with the _standalone Docker_ engine and with _Docker Swarm mode_.
